## Milestone : 9
Today, we will create a frontend form for taking products input. Let‚Äôs dive in and understand what this all means!
Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:
Learn how to create a form that will take all the details of product
Learn how to take multiple images as input.
Why Create Product form?
Here we will create an form to input all the details of product.
This details will be eventually saved in database and will be displayed on products home page we created in previous milestone.
Steps for Milestone 9üìù
Create the form for products
This form will take multiple product images images as input
Note:- This lesson will help you in understanding the basic creating of products please feel free to experiment on adding more features like creating an admin access and allow only admin to upload products or create and shop profile and a user with only shop profile can upload.


## Milestone 10:
**Creating the Product Schema and API Endpoint**
In this milestone, we focused on defining the structure of product data and creating an API endpoint to store product details in MongoDB.
1. Product Schema Definition:
- Defined a structured product schema using Mongoose to store product data in MongoDB.
- Ensured each field has proper validation to maintain data integrity:
- Name: Required, string**
- Description: Required, string
- Price: Required, number, with validation for non-negative values
- Image URL(s): Required, array of strings for multiple image storage
- Category: Required, string
- CreatedAt: Automatically generated timestamp
2. Endpoint Creation:
- Developed a POST endpoint (/api/products) to accept product details from the frontend.
- Implemented validation to ensure only correctly formatted data is stored in the database.
- Saved product information to MongoDB using Mongoose models.
3. Data Validation & Integrity:
- Enforced strict validation to prevent invalid or incomplete product entries.
- Returned appropriate error messages for missing or incorrect data inputs.
4. Future Enhancements & Experimentation:
- Considered adding role-based access control:
- Admin Access: Only admin users can create new products.
- Shop Profiles: Restrict product uploads to users with a registered shop profile.
- Image Upload Handling: Implement a cloud-based solution (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3) for better image management. make this short
